        <main>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Get the details of the application from enterprise test portal. (See if it is Managed or Unmanaged application, if it is unmanaged and you are bouncing it before 4:00 PM MST, make sure that you confirm if a rolling or complete bounce is needed. If a complete bounce is required make sure that all testing teams are conveyed before starting as it counts for downtime of the application)</p></li>
                <li><p>Open the Java Install Manager Tool. Select the application and the Test Environment from the drop down available at the top right corner of the IM.</p></li>
                <li><p>Spawn the putty sessions for that application in that Test Env.</p></li>
                <li><p>Now do wlsdeploy or fireant depending on the deployment script app uses.</p></li>
                <li><p>Now, enter the alias id.(Note that app id and alias id might not be same for an app)</p></li>
                <li><p>For Wlsdeploy - After that a dropdown menu appears. Either you can select 7 and 8 in turn to first stop and then start the cluster respectively OR you can directly select option 8 that says cluster restart.</p></li>
                <li><p>For Fireant â€“ Enter the option number 16 and then 17 OR only 17</p></li>
                <li><p>Now check if all the servers are in RUNNING mode. This is better checked if we look for logs and console both.</p></li>
                <li><p>Check the URLs.</p></li>
                <li><p>If all seems fine close the putty sessions or else troubleshoot and debug it.</p></li>
                <li><p>Since bounce will always be asked as a part of defect, please update the defect and close it choosing proper options in QC.</p></li>

            <p><u><b>Examples:</b></u></p>
            <p>Let us take Qcordering ITV3 for example.</p>
            <p>So we need to spawn putty session for Qcordering in ITV3 test Env. And after giving wlsdeploy <b>(since it uses wlsdeploy script)</b> we should give qcordering3 that implies alias id for this app is qcordering3. <b>(However app-id for same is qcorder.)</b> For this app, we need to take permission from ETRM, if a complete bounce is asked before 4:00 PM MST as it is a Managed Application.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Now let us take IOT ITV2.</p>
            <p>Again we will spawn putty session for IOT in ITV2 Test Env. Here you have to give fireant <b>(as this app uses fireant script)</b>. And now give iot2 as alias-id. <b>(However app-id is iotecom)</b>. You can do a complete bounce if you are not clear with instructions mentioned by requestor on the request as it is an Unmanaged application.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Point to Note:</b>When we say an app uses wlsdeploy/fireant script we actually mean that weblogic version on which app is installed is 8 or higher. For apps using Weblogic version 8, fireant is used and for other higher weblogic versions wlsdeploy script is used.</p>
            <p>You can find the <b>Appid</b> and <b>Aliasid</b> from the inventory refer below screen shot for the same</p>
